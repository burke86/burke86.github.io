## Research

My scientific interests live at the intersection of computation, observation, and instrumentation. I've worked with modeling a variety of telescopes, including the WIYN 3.5-meter telescope, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, and the James Webb Space Telescope.

### Undergraduate Thesis

I worked with [Professor John R Peterson](https://lsst.rcac.purdue.edu/) at Purdue for over three years, developing and improving the [Photon Simulator (PhoSim)](https://bitbucket.org/phosim/phosim_release/wiki/Home) software, and spearheading PhoSim's use for internal simulations for the James Webb Space Telescope's Near-Infrared Camera. My work resulted in a small contract for our group from our collaborators, [Dr. Eiichi Egami](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/eiichi-egami) and [Professor Marcia J Rieke](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/marcia-j-rieke) at the University of Arizona and Steward Observatory. I earned the [Richard W. King award](http://www.physics.purdue.edu/about/prizes_awards/undergraduate_awards.html#King) for my work.

### WIYN 3.5-meter Observations

Proposal: ["Weak Lensing in Clusters of Galaxies with PhoSim"](https://www.noao.edu/noaoprop/abstract.mpl?2017B-0824).

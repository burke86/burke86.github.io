# Research

My scientific interests live at the intersection of computation, observation, and instrumentation.

## Undergraduate Work

I worked with [Professor John R. Peterson](https://lsst.rcac.purdue.edu/) at Purdue for over three years, developing and improving the [Photon Simulator (PhoSim)](https://bitbucket.org/phosim/phosim_release/wiki/Home) software for use with modeling a variety of telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, and the WIYN 3.5-meter telescope.

### James Webb Space Telescope

I worked with [Professor John R. Peterson](https://lsst.rcac.purdue.edu/) at Purdue for over three years, developing and improving the [Photon Simulator (PhoSim)](https://bitbucket.org/phosim/phosim_release/wiki/Home) software, and spearheading PhoSim's use for internal simulations for the James Webb Space Telescope's Near-Infrared Camera. My work resulted in a small contract for our group from our collaborators, [Dr. Eiichi Egami](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/eiichi-egami) and [Professor Marcia J. Rieke](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/marcia-j-rieke) at the University of Arizona and Steward Observatory. I earned the [Richard W. King award](http://www.physics.purdue.edu/about/prizes_awards/undergraduate_awards.html#King) for my work.

I completed two nights of observations at the WIYN 3.5-meter Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona using the One Degree Imager (ODI) instrument. We experimented with LSST-like survey techniques (short exposures, comparison with physics-based computer models). We observed two clusters of galaxies, Abell 115 and Abell 2390:

Pretty pictures coming soon!

I modeled the WIYN/ODI optical system in PhoSim:

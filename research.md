# Research



## Undergraduate Work

I worked with [Professor John R. Peterson](https://lsst.rcac.purdue.edu/) at Purdue for over three years, developing and improving the [Photon Simulator (PhoSim)](https://bitbucket.org/phosim/phosim_release/wiki/Home) software for use with modeling a variety of telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, and the WIYN 3.5-meter telescope.

### James Webb Space Telescope

I extended PhoSim's code for use with internal simulations of the Near-Infrared Camera. My work resulted in a small contract for our group from our collaborators, at the University of Arizona, lead by [Professor Marcia J. Rieke](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/marcia-j-rieke). I earned the [Richard W. King award](http://www.physics.purdue.edu/about/prizes_awards/undergraduate_awards.html#King) for my work.

### Large Synoptic Survey Telescope

Coming soon

### WIYN 3.5-meter Telescope

["Weak Lensing in Clusters of Galaxies with PhoSim"](https://www.noao.edu/noaoprop/abstract.mpl?2017B-0824)

I completed multiple nights of observations at the WIYN 3.5-meter Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona using the One Degree Imager (ODI) instrument. We experimented with LSST-like survey techniques (short exposures, comparison with physics-based computer models). We observed three clusters of galaxies, Abell 115, Abell 2390, and Abell 611:

Pretty pictures coming soon!

I modeled the WIYN/ODI optical system in PhoSim:

Image of the WIYN 3.5-meter Telescope PhoSim model. Rays from a star are shown propogating through the telescope mirrors, camera lenses and atmospheric dispersion corrector, filter, and the focal plane. The full CCD array is also modeled, but not shown in this diagram.

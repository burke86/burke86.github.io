# About Me

I am an observational astronomer working on problems related to supermassive black hole formation and evolution, [intermediate-mass black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate-mass_black_hole), and [AGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus) variability. I completed my PhD at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2023. In August 2023, I will begin an NSF Astronomy & Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship at Yale University. 


# Intermediate-mass black holes

Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) had to exist at some point in cosmic time to form the observed population of supermassive black holes.

### AGN Variability

I use optical imaging surveys to study the variability (or "flickering") of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and gain new insights into their central engines. Our recent work establishes a mass-timescale relation, whereby AGN variability can be used to estimate the mass of the central black hole. It was published in the journal _Science_ (also see articles in [_Popular Science_](https://www.popsci.com/space/weigh-black-hole/), [_Science News_](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-holes-mass-measure-new-technique-accretion-disk), and [_space.com_](https://www.space.com/black-hole-feeding-pattern-mass-size)):

I am particularly interested in AGNs in dwarf galaxies which may harbor intermediate-mass black holes. See our paper on a low-mass AGN identified from optical imaging at redshift 0.82: [H. Guo, C. J. Burke, et al. _MNRAS_ 496, 3636 (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.3636G/abstract).

Also see our work on the variability of the "poster-child" dwarf AGN NGC 4395: [C. J. Burke et al. _ApJ_ 899, 136 (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...899..136B/abstract).

### Other Time-Domain Astrophysics

During our search, we also found a peculiar long-lived stellar transient in the metal-poor galaxy PHL 293B. I collaborated with Prof. Vivienne Baldassare to study this perplexing dwarf galaxy. Using data we obtained from the Gemini Observatory, we found the unusually-luminous broad Balmer emission has begun to fade away in recent years. We concluded the variability, despite appearing similar to that of an AGN, is actually likely due to a massive outburst of a luminous blue variable star, resembling the transient event SDSS1133. Our observations ruled-out some interpretations put-forth in previous papers.

### Machine Learning 

I worked with fellow graduate student Patrick Aleo to adapt a new machine learning code to classify and deblend sources using the "Mask R-CNN" architecture for image segmentation. I have also had the privilege of mentoring and advising two undergraduate students, Anshul Shah ([view SPIN poster](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/burke86/burke86.github.io/blob/master/assets/SPIN_Poster.pdf)) and Yufeng Liu, through the [NCSA SPIN](http://spin.ncsa.illinois.edu/) research program.

## Undergraduate Work

I worked with [Professor John R. Peterson](https://lsst.rcac.purdue.edu/) at Purdue for over three years, developing and improving the [Photon Simulator (PhoSim)](https://bitbucket.org/phosim/phosim_release/wiki/Home) software for use with modeling a variety of telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, and the WIYN 3.5-meter telescope. Our goal is for these physics-based models to help better-constrain [weak lensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_gravitational_lensing) studies as well as providing high-fidelity mock data to test image pipelines.

I extended PhoSim's code for use with internal simulations of the Near-Infrared Camera. My work resulted in a small contract for our group from our collaborators at the University of Arizona. I earned the [Richard W. King award](http://www.physics.purdue.edu/about/prizes_awards/undergraduate_awards.html#King) for my work.

See our [PhoSim-NIRCam paper](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Astronomical-Telescopes-Instruments-and-Systems/volume-5/issue-3/038002/PhoSim-NIRCam--photon-by-photon-image-simulations-of-the/10.1117/1.JATIS.5.3.038002.short?SSO=1) for details.

I also completed multiple nights of observations at the WIYN 3.5-meter Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona using the One Degree Imager (ODI) instrument. As part of our work, I performed initial modeling the WIYN/ODI optical system in PhoSim, with the goal of calibrating the physics in PhoSim. See our [paper on deformation of optics for photon Monte Carlo simulations](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab0418).


# Outreach

### "Great American Solar Eclipse" of 2017

I lead an effort with [eclipse2017.org](www.eclipse2017.org), Dr. David Sederberg, and the Purdue Astronomy Club to distribute 10,000 solar eclipse glasses to local schools, libraries, and students. We wrote grants, rallied volunteers, and gathered our solar-filtered telescopes to get the most out of the partial eclipse.

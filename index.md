- ["Great American Solar Eclipse"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_21,_2017) of 2017

I lead an effort with [eclipse2017.org](www.eclipse2017.org), Dr. David Sederberg, and the Purdue Astronomy Club to distribute 10,000 solar eclipse glasses to local schools, libraries, and students. We wrote grants, rallied volunteers, and gathered our solar-filtered telescopes to get the most out of the partial eclipse.

# Research

## Undergraduate Work

I worked with [Professor John R. Peterson](https://lsst.rcac.purdue.edu/) at Purdue for over three years, developing and improving the [Photon Simulator (PhoSim)](https://bitbucket.org/phosim/phosim_release/wiki/Home) software for use with modeling a variety of telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, and the WIYN 3.5-meter telescope. Our goal is for these physics-based models to help better-contrain [weak lensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_gravitational_lensing) studies as well as providing high-fidelity mock data to test image pipelines.

### James Webb Space Telescope

I extended PhoSim's code for use with internal simulations of the Near-Infrared Camera. My work resulted in a small contract for our group from our collaborators at the University of Arizona, lead by [Professor Marcia J. Rieke](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/marcia-j-rieke). I earned the [Richard W. King award](http://www.physics.purdue.edu/about/prizes_awards/undergraduate_awards.html#King) for my work.

### WIYN 3.5-meter Telescope

["Weak Lensing in Clusters of Galaxies with PhoSim"](https://www.noao.edu/noaoprop/abstract.mpl?2017B-0824)

I completed multiple nights of observations at the WIYN 3.5-meter Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona using the One Degree Imager (ODI) instrument. We experimented with LSST-like survey techniques (short exposures, comparison with physics-based computer models). We observed three clusters of galaxies: Abell 115, Abell 2390, and Abell 611:

I modeled the WIYN/ODI optical system in PhoSim, with the goal of calibrating the physics:

# Outreach

## ["Great American Solar Eclipse" of 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_21,_2017)

I lead an effort with [eclipse2017.org](www.eclipse2017.org), Dr. David Sederberg, and the Purdue Astronomy Club to distribute 10,000 solar eclipse glasses to local schools, libraries, and students. We wrote grants, rallied volunteers, and gathered our solar-filtered telescopes to get the most out of the partial eclipse.

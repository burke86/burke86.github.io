### Low-mass AGN Variability

I am working with Dark Energy Survey images to find variability in dwarf galaxies. The variability-selection technique has several advantages, such as finding AGNs with smaller supermassive black holes than other methods. See our paper on the lowest-mass AGN found from optical imaging at redshift 0.82.

[MNRAS 496, 3636 (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.3636G/abstract).

We are also using light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to study the variability of AGNs as part of project TEQUILA (Shen et al in prep.) See our work on the variability of the dwarf AGN NGC 4395.

Stay tuned for exciting new results!

### Other Time-Domain Astrophysics

During our search, we also found a peculiar long-lived stellar transient in the metal-poor galaxy PHL 293B. I collaborated with Prof. Vivienne Baldassare to study this perplexing dwarf galaxy. Using data we obtained from the Gemini Observatory, we found the unusually-luminous broad Balmer emission has begun to fade away in recent years. We concluded the variability, despite appearing similar to that of an AGN, is actually likely due to a massive outburst of a luminous blue variable star, resembling the transient event SDSS1133. Our observations ruled-out some interpretations put-forth in previous papers.

### Machine Learning 

I worked with fellow graduate student Patrick Aleo to adapt a new machine learning code to classify and deblend sources using the "Mask R-CNN" architecture for image segmentation. I have also had the privilege of mentoring and advising two undergraduate students, Anshul Shah ([view SPIN poster](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/burke86/burke86.github.io/blob/master/assets/SPIN_Poster.pdf)) and Yufeng Liu, through the NCSA SPIN research program.

## Undergraduate Work

I worked with [Professor John R. Peterson](https://lsst.rcac.purdue.edu/) at Purdue for over three years, developing and improving the [Photon Simulator (PhoSim)](https://bitbucket.org/phosim/phosim_release/wiki/Home) software for use with modeling a variety of telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, and the WIYN 3.5-meter telescope. Our goal is for these physics-based models to help better-constrain [weak lensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_gravitational_lensing) studies as well as providing high-fidelity mock data to test image pipelines.

I extended PhoSim's code for use with internal simulations of the Near-Infrared Camera. My work resulted in a small contract for our group from our collaborators at the University of Arizona. I earned the [Richard W. King award](http://www.physics.purdue.edu/about/prizes_awards/undergraduate_awards.html#King) for my work.

See our [PhoSim-NIRCam paper](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Astronomical-Telescopes-Instruments-and-Systems/volume-5/issue-3/038002/PhoSim-NIRCam--photon-by-photon-image-simulations-of-the/10.1117/1.JATIS.5.3.038002.short?SSO=1) for details.

I also completed multiple nights of observations at the WIYN 3.5-meter Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona using the One Degree Imager (ODI) instrument. As part of our work, I performed initial modeling the WIYN/ODI optical system in PhoSim, with the goal of calibrating the physics in PhoSim. See our [paper on deformation of optics for photon Monte Carlo simulations](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab0418).


# Outreach

["Great American Solar Eclipse" of 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_21,_2017)

I lead an effort with [eclipse2017.org](www.eclipse2017.org), Dr. David Sederberg, and the Purdue Astronomy Club to distribute 10,000 solar eclipse glasses to local schools, libraries, and students. We wrote grants, rallied volunteers, and gathered our solar-filtered telescopes to get the most out of the partial eclipse.

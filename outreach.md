# Outreach

### Broader Impacts

As an NSF AAPF postdoctoral fellow, I will lead a outreach program to expose local high school students to data science in astronomy.

### "Great American Solar Eclipse" of 2017

I lead an effort with [eclipse2017.org](www.eclipse2017.org), Dr. David Sederberg, and the Purdue Astronomy Club to distribute 10,000 solar eclipse glasses to local schools, libraries, and students. We wrote grants, rallied volunteers, and gathered our solar-filtered telescopes to get the most out of the partial eclipse.
